Today, I visited some remarkable government smart schools, where education is being revolutionized through collaboration between private companies and the government. These schools are dedicated to digitizing education and providing students and teachers with access to cutting-edge technologies.

One particularly impressive feature I encountered was the planetarium. Specifically designed for primary students, it offers an immersive experience for learning about astronomical events. Equipped with a 3D projector that eliminates the need for glasses, stepping into the planetarium feels like entering space itself. Complete with telescopes, educational materials on space and celestial bodies, including our solar system and the Milky Way, as well as information on astronauts, the planetarium aims to spark curiosity among students and foster an interest in space exploration.

Another standout feature is the science lab, which houses over 500 working science models. These practical demonstrations serve to enhance students' understanding of various scientific concepts, covering fields such as electromagnetism, biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and astronomy. By providing hands-on experiences and visual representations, these labs offer a more engaging alternative to traditional teaching method.

In addition, the schools boast "future classes" where students in grades 6 to 8 receive instruction in computer science. Each student is provided with an Asus Chromebook to learn the basics of computing. These classrooms are equipped with 65-inch smart TVs that support both Windows and Android operating systems, featuring touch-screen capabilities, projectors, and interactive whiteboards. Lectures can be recorded for later review, and students have access to e-books for reference, fostering a dynamic learning environment that encourages critical thinking and innovation.

Furthermore, the schools utilize customized wallpapers to adorn their walls, serving as educational aids that display alphabets, times tables, computer xshortcuts, inspirational quotes, and more.

Overall, my visit to these smart schools was enlightening and inspiring. It's truly remarkable to witness the transformation taking place in the education sector, as innovative approaches pave the way for enhanced learning experiences.
